# RPSCasinoProject
Proposal
Content Description: Our website will be featuring the classic game of luck rock, paper, scissors, where the user plays against an AI, and following our theme of luck our theme for the website will be of a casino where our landing page looks like an entrance to a grand casino. The game is played by each player getting dealt three random cards which have faces representing what they are and after choosing one card both players reveal their card in unison and if there is a draw the game is replayed with a new hand. The other pages are related by increasing complexity as the second page will have a slider that adjusts the difficulty of the game, the higher one sets the difficulty, the AI will know an X amount of cards the player received and play accordingly. The third page will not only have the slider but also a more complex variation of RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. 

Anthony’s Responsibilities:
My core responsibilities will be JavaScript. I will be working on the animation of the game with anime.js as well as implementing the core gameplay programming, implementing the slider difficulties as well as the bot’s programming. If needed, I will assist Sean in his HTML and CSS as well as his implementation of the variation of the game.


Sean’s Responsibilities:
My core responsibilities will be to setup the webpages with CSS and HTML, I will also be working on the third page of the website which would feature the variation of rock, paper, scissors.

What We’ll Need: 
We will be using both anime.js and GreenSock to implement the animation for the game in JavaScript. We will need to learn HTML Canvas to implement our visuals. We also might explore using Materialize for the HTML and CSS setup.
