# RPSCasinoProject
Proposal
Content Description: Our website will be featuring the classic game of luck rock, paper, scissors, where the user plays against an AI, and following our theme of luck our theme for the website will be of a casino. The game is played by each player getting dealt three random cards which have faces representing what they are and after choosing one card which card each player played will be revealed and if there is a draw the game is replayed with a new hand. Every page will have a playlist playing with a slider to adjust the volume and a button to switch between songs. All songs are from the game series Persona. The third page will not only have the slider but also a more complex variation of RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. 

Anthony’s Responsibilities:
Originally, my roles were to be gameplay programming. However, Sean and I switched roles. As such, my role became the core HTML, CSS, SVG graphics (all images aside from the playing cards are SVGs), and the overall design of the project. A lot of my time was spent with audio and anime.js. As well, I assisted Sean as a sort of utility player when problems arose with the code.


Sean’s Responsibilities:
Role: Javascript for game state and interactivity with the game
	Our project is a rock paper scissors card game, where all cards and interactivity is done through javascript. Each card has a graphic that represents the value of the choice and using jqueryUI, each card is draggable and able to be dropped on specific dropzones. Initially began the project with the idea that I would set up the content and design of the page but when I first started to code the pages I realized there was no point in really doing the HTML unless there was already existing javascript code that creates the cards and interactivity we wanted. At this point, Anthony and I switch roles, where I begin coding the javascript game code. Due to the nature of card games, I looked for a tutorial online to first learn how to recreate a deck of cards and functions such as shuffling and creating new decks. The tutorial I mainly used was from Brainjar (http://www.brainjar.com/js/cards/ and http://www.brainjar.com/js/blackjack/default.asp). The tutorial describes how to make card objects and certain methods such as shuffle and draw, which, I changed quite a bit to suit my needs. The card object does not need a rank or suit but only a value that was the representation of the rock paper scissors value, and I also learned how to use Javascript object prototypes, because my javascript objects I created such as Card, Stack, Deck, and Hand were not correctly inheriting the method properties due to proper scope. The tutorial I used was not perfect for my needs due to the inherent difference of what the cards represented and that I was implementing the jquery UI library to utilize drag and drop for the cards. In order to create my draggable images and implement the jquery droppable I had to initialize the script during my StartRound because I created the draggable cards during initialization and if I had the jquery draggable and droppable script initialized at the head then the images were not drag or droppable because the jquery looks for already existing elements in the DOM. Additionally, I initially only had one dropzone that accepted all cards that belonged to the player but as I learning to use droppable, I had to be able to figure a way around getting the correct value the player placed the card dropped as I learned this.draggable accepts an element of the DOM not the javascript object, therefore I could not access the player’s card object’s value property. Therefore, to put into the CompareCards method the correct value of what the player played, I set the value in javascript based on which droppable the player puts it in.    During the course of the project I learned a great deal on scope for javascript and better understanding of how to use javascript for functionality and am much more familiar and comfortable in the language than I was before.
What We’ll Need: 
We will be using anime.js to implement the animation for the game in JavaScript. We used JQueryUI and learned CSS and HTML techniques to implement the site without using a framework. As well, we worked with audio.
