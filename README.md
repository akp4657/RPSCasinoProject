# RPSCasinoProject
Proposal
Content Description: Our website will be featuring the classic game of luck rock, paper, scissors, where the user plays against an AI, and following our theme of luck our theme for the website will be of a casino. The game is played by each player getting dealt three random cards which have faces representing what they are and after choosing one card both players reveal their card in unison and if there is a draw the game is replayed with a new hand. Every page will have a playlist playing with a slider to adjust the volume and a button to switch between songs. All songs are from the game series Persona. The third page will not only have the slider but also a more complex variation of RPS: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. 

Anthony’s Responsibilities:
Originally, my roles were to be gameplay programming. However, Sean and I switched roles. As such, my role became the core HTML, CSS, SVG graphics (all images aside from the playing cards are SVGs), and the overall design of the project. A lot of my time was spent with audio and anime.js. As well, I assisted Sean as a sort of utility player when problems arose with the code.


Sean’s Responsibilities:
My core responsibilities will be to setup the webpages with CSS and HTML, I will also be working on the third page of the website which would feature the variation of rock, paper, scissors.

What We’ll Need: 
We will be using both anime.js and GreenSock to implement the animation for the game in JavaScript. We used JQueryUI and learned CSS and HTML techniques to implement the site without using a framework. As well, we worked with audio.
