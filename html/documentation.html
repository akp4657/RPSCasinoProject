        <h2>Role: Javascript for game state and interactivity with the game</h2>
        <p>
                Our project is a rock paper scissors card game, where all cards and interactivity is done through javascript. Each card has a graphic that represents the value of the choice and using jqueryUI, each card is draggable and able to be dropped on specific dropzones. Initially began the project with the idea that I would set up the content and design of the page but when I first started to code the pages I realized there was no point in really doing the HTML unless there was already existing javascript code that creates the cards and interactivity we wanted. At this point, Anthony and I switch roles, where I begin coding the javascript game code. Due to the nature of card games, I looked for a tutorial online to first learn how to recreate a deck of cards and functions such as shuffling and creating new decks. The tutorial I mainly used was from <a href="http://www.brainjar.com/js/cards/">Brainjar Cards</a> and <a href="http://www.brainjar.com/js/blackjack/default.asp">Brainjar Blackjack</a>. The tutorial describes how to make card objects and certain methods such as shuffle and draw, which, I changed quite a bit to suit my needs. The card object does not need a rank or suit but only a value that was the representation of the rock paper scissors value, and I also learned how to use Javascript object prototypes, because my javascript objects I created such as Card, Stack, Deck, and Hand were not correctly inheriting the method properties due to proper scope. The tutorial I used was not perfect for my needs due to the inherent difference of what the cards represented and that I was implementing the jquery UI library to utilize drag and drop for the cards. In order to create my draggable images and implement the jquery droppable I had to initialize the script during my StartRound because I created the draggable cards during initialization and if I had the jquery draggable and droppable script initialized at the head then the images were not drag or droppable because the jquery looks for already existing elements in the DOM. Additionally, I initially only had one dropzone that accepted all cards that belonged to the player but as I learning to use droppable, I had to be able to figure a way around getting the correct value the player placed the card dropped as I learned this.draggable accepts an element of the DOM not the javascript object, therefore I could not access the player’s card object’s value property. Therefore, to put into the CompareCards method the correct value of what the player played, I set the value in javascript based on which droppable the player puts it in.    During the course of the project I learned a great deal on scope for javascript and better understanding of how to use javascript for functionality and am much more familiar and comfortable in the language than I was before.</p>

        <h2>Anthony Pichardo</h2>
        <h2>Role: UI/UX, Design, Animation, Audio, and JS helper</h2> 
        <p>	While the original roles were to have me be the gameplay programmer and Sean focusing on design, we eventually switched, as Sean stated. Most of my work was done working with anime.js, and audio. As well, all of the images present are SVG graphics, the background image on the main game being one that I edited myself. It was confusing at first for me to figure out how to get the input slider to work with the volume, but I figured out how to do it arbitrarily with HTML and one line of JS rather than using just JS. With anime.js, there is a strange thing with the spinning boxes where, on Google Chrome, the animation loops through x-1 times. It took me a while to figure out that issue and I could not find any source as to why Google Chrome had this issue, because every other browser works fine. The resources used for anime were mostly from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7WnZ9hxUak">video tutorial</a> I did for an exercise as well as anime.js’s <a href="http://animejs.com/documentation/">documentation</a>. I essentially had to learn about audio and anime for the most part. I dove deeper into the differences between display and other css attributes in order to align the different divs and generated images together to make a nice looking game board. When I wasn't working with my part of the project, I was essentially the backup for Sean if an issue came with his code or a bug popped up while I was working on my job.</p>

            <li>Worked with HTML audio and generated a playlist using JS.</li>
            <li>Used JS to control audio with an HTML input slider.</li>
            <li>Worked with anime.js to animate boxes when win condition fires.</li> 
            <li>Edited the main background image, the title box, and created the cards front and back in photoshop.</li>
